# FRABID-Dataset-Results
This repository contains the results of the experiments done to validate our approach of the Frame rate adaptation based image difference (FRABID) algorithm.
It is separated to three datasets:
1. The first file contains the results of the FRABID and STAFRA algorithm made on the Highway dataset from " Link".
2. The second file contains the results of the FRABID and STAFRA algorithm made on the PETS2006 dataset from " Link".
